This notebook contains code for building a neural network with one hidden layer from scratch for planar data classification.


## Here are the main parts that constituted the entire project

* Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
* Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
* Compute the cross entropy loss
* Implement forward and backward propagation
