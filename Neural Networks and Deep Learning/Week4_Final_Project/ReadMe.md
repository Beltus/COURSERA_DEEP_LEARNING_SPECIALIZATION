This repository contains two notebooks. 
## Notebook 1: Building Your Deep Neural Network Step by Step. 
The notebook implements that are neccesary for building both a 2 layer and a deep L-layer neural 
network functions  a deep neural network.

## Notebook 2: Deep Neural Network For Image Classification: Application
By using the methods implemented in notebook, I built a 2 layer Neural network and a 4 layer deep neural network to classify 
cat images.
