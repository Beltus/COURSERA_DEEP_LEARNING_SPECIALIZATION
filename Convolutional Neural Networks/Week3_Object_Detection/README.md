## Autonomous driving - Car detection
In this project we learn about object detection using the very powerful YOLO model. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016.

The main parts of this implementation consisted of:
* Using object detection on a car detection dataset
* Dealing with bounding boxes
