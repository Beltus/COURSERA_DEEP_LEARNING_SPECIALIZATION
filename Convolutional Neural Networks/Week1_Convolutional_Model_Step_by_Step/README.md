## Step_by_step Convolutional Model ipynb file implements convolutional and pooling layers in Numpy
Welcome to Course 4's first assignment! In this assignment, 
you will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, 
including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation.
